1. What are the advantages of using Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis?
Jupyter Notebooks offer several key benefits:

Interactive execution: Code runs in small blocks (cells), allowing immediate feedback and testing.

Integrated visualization: Easily create and view charts inline using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Experimentation-friendly: You can modify and re-run specific parts without restarting the whole program.

Reproducibility: Combines code, results, and documentation in one file, making analysis easy to follow and replicate.

Collaboration and education: Ideal for sharing work with teammates or students in a clear and accessible format.

2. How does Jupyter improve workflows compared to standalone Python scripts?
Feature	Python Scripts (.py)	Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
Execution flow	Runs from top to bottom	Can run any cell in any order
Output and visualization	Output appears in terminal or separate	Output appears directly below each cell
Documentation	Code comments only	Full Markdown support for explanations
Iteration and debugging	Requires re-running the entire script	Change and test small blocks of code easily
Presentation and reporting	Not user-friendly	Ideal for storytelling with data

3. What are Markdown cells, and why are they useful in notebooks?
Markdown cells are text cells in Jupyter Notebooks where you can write plain explanations using Markdown formatting. They’re useful for:

Adding titles, headings, and bullet points to structure your notebook

Explaining code logic or findings in plain language

Embedding formulas and equations using LaTeX

Turning a technical notebook into a readable, self-contained report

This makes the notebook easier to understand, share, and maintain.

4. How could Jupyter Notebooks be used for analyzing Focus Bear’s user trends?
Jupyter Notebooks can support Focus Bear’s product and data teams by:

Loading and cleaning usage data
Import logs, filter time ranges, and segment by user behavior.

Visualizing engagement
Use line charts to show daily/weekly active users, bar charts for feature usage, or histograms for session lengths.

Analyzing user retention
Track user cohorts over time and visualize return rates by signup date or feature used.

Running A/B test analyses
Compare metrics across variants using statistical plots or summary tables.

Communicating insights
Use Markdown cells to document each step, add insights, and create a report that product managers or stakeholders can review.

Prototyping models
Test user segmentation, churn prediction, or other ML-based experiments in an interactive environment.
