1. Why is Python preferred for data analytics over other languages?
Python is widely preferred in data analytics because:

Readable and easy to learn: Simple syntax lowers the barrier for entry.

Extensive libraries: Rich ecosystem (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn) for analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Versatile: Suitable for quick scripts, large-scale pipelines, and machine learning.

Strong community support: Abundant tutorials, documentation, and active developer forums.

Integration-friendly: Works well with databases, cloud tools, and web apps.

Compared to R or Excel, Python is more scalable and programmable, while compared to Java or C++, itâ€™s much more agile for analytics tasks.

2. What role does Pandas play in data analysis?
Pandas is the core library for data manipulation in Python. It allows analysts to:

Load data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON)

Clean, transform, and reshape data easily

Perform filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregations

Handle missing or inconsistent values

Merge or join datasets

Perform time-series analysis

Pandas serves as the backbone of any data workflow, especially during the exploratory and preparation phases.

3. How do Matplotlib and Seaborn help with data visualization?
These two libraries are essential for turning raw data into visual insights:

Matplotlib: The foundational library for creating custom plots. It provides control over every element (axes, labels, grids), ideal for tailored or publication-level visualizations.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, it simplifies the creation of attractive and statistically informative charts like:

Distribution plots (histogram, KDE)

Categorical plots (box, violin, bar)

Correlation plots (heatmaps, pair plots)

Regression and time-series plots

Seaborn is excellent for quick exploratory visuals, while Matplotlib is more flexible for custom outputs.
