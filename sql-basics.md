1. How does SQL help in data analysis?
SQL helps you get the data you need from a database. You can use it to find information, filter results, and get summaries like totals and averages. It’s useful for spotting trends and answering questions with real data.

2. What is the difference between filtering (WHERE) and aggregation (GROUP BY)?

WHERE is used to pick out specific rows of data (like users from a certain country).

GROUP BY is used to group the data and do calculations (like count how many users are in each country).

3. How would you retrieve and analyze user activity data in Focus Bear’s database?
First, decide what you want to learn (like how many focus sessions each user does). Then, use SQL to pull that data, summarize it by user or time, and look for patterns.

4. Why is learning SQL important even if you mostly use Python?
SQL helps you get the right data before you analyze it in Python. It’s faster and better for working with big databases. Knowing both SQL and Python makes you a stronger data analyst.
