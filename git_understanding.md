1. What is the difference between staging and committing?
- Staging: telling Git what changes you are about to make
- Commiting: taking snapshots of the changes
  + The commit only includes what was staged 

2. Why does Git separate these two steps?
- Commit allows you to select or combine many stages together so we can have a meaningful history of workflow

3. When would you want to stage changes without committing?
- When you make edits to your file, you should stage changes so that you can save them 

=> Git separates staging and committing to let you be intentional about your commits â€” like curating a playlist instead of dumping every song.
